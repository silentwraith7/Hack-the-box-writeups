# Hack The Box Writeups 🚩

This repository contains my personal notes and write-ups for various **Hack The Box** (HTB) machines — primarily from the **Starting Point** series. These write-ups focus on **methodology, thought process**, and **lessons learned** during each machine.

> ⚠️ All flags, passwords, and sensitive details have been redacted to comply with [HTB's Terms of Service](https://www.hackthebox.com/legal/terms).

## 🧠 Why these writeups?

- Reinforce concepts like enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation
- Build a personal reference of what I’ve learned
- Share my journey from beginner to hopefully advanced 👾

## 📁 Structure

Each machine has its own markdown file with the following rough structure:

- Initial enumeration (`nmap`, `ftp`, `http`, etc.)
- Vulnerability identification
- Exploitation steps
- Privilege escalation
- Root access
- Summary and key takeaways

## 🔐 Disclaimer

This repository is strictly for **educational purposes**. These machines are publicly available on [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com) under the "Starting Point" or similar tracks. Do not attempt any unauthorized attacks on live systems.

## 📌 Notes

- If you're stuck, walkthroughs and hints are a tool — but always try to break things down manually.
- Some tools used: `nmap`, `ftp`, `sqlmap`, `hashcat`, `john`, `netcat`, `ssh`, and good old `grep` and `vi`.

## 📬 Contact

You can reach me on GitHub or drop me a message if you're also learning and want to connect.
